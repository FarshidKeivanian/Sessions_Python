I recently flew with Qantas and had a great experience. The staff were friendly, and the flight was on time.
However, my Telstra internet connection in Sydney has been very unreliable lately. I hope they fix it soon.
Overall, I feel positive about the service I received from Qantas but disappointed with Telstra's performance.
